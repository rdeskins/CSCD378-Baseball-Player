# Baseball Player Web App
This is an extra credit assignment for the Web Application Development course at EWU. It is made using the [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) framework. The project is intended to show an understanding of database seeding, database accessing, model/view/controller, routing, table sorting, basic CRUD operations, CSS, and Laravel's relationships. 
The database seeder generates 100 baseball players and a number of games. The games model holds stats for each individual game. Both players and games can be created, viewed, updated, and deleted. 

The app is hosted on Heroku and can be viewed [here](http://baseball-player-app.herokuapp.com/players)! :)
